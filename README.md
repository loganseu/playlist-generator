# What is playlist-generator?
This project consists of a set of Python scripts that uses Spotify's and Youtube's API to scrape music from various sources, and inserts it into a Spotify playlist. To automate the process, a task using Windows Task Scheduler executes the script at every interval specified. An installation guide will not be provided, as the music recommendations are catered to my preferences. However, the code will still be provided for reference.
